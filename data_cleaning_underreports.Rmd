## This is a document that imports uunderreports data from IHME

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# April 2023: Undercounting COVID Cases
# clear R's brain
rm( list = ls())
# load libraries
preq = c( "dplyr", "ggplot2", "ggfortify", "readxl", "readstata13", 
          "readr", "stats", "tidyverse", "haven", "Matrix", "foreign", "zoo")
#for (y in preq) install.packages(y, dep = TRUE)
sapply(preq, library, character.only=T)

# Set the directory where the files are located
setwd("G:/My\ Drive/Documents/R_github/underreporting")
```

##Import IHME Data
```{r IHME_import, echo=TRUE}
# Create a list of the file names
files <- list.files(path = "../Data/IHME/",  pattern = ".csv")
# Use grep() function to select strings starting with "myfile"
selected <- files[grep("^data_download", files)]
selected <- week <- paste( "../Data/IHME/", selected, sep="")
# View the selected strings
selected
# Read in the files and store in a list
data_list <- lapply(selected, read.csv)
View(data_list[[1]])
#lapply(data_list, colnames)
#check if all columns are identical
all(colnames(data_list[[1]]) == colnames(data_list[[2]])) ==
  all(colnames(data_list[[1]]) == colnames(data_list[[3]]))
# Bind the data frames into a single data frame
data_stack <- do.call(rbind, data_list)
View(data_stack)
```


```{r under_report, echo=TRUE}
#calculate under_reports by country and drop missing values
data_under <- 
  data_stack %>%
# Create a column for the 7 day moving average of sales for each location using zoo::rollapplyr
  group_by(location_name) %>%
  mutate(
    inf_mean_7d = rollapplyr(inf_mean, 7, mean, fill = NA, align = "right"),
    cases_mean_7d = rollapplyr(cases_mean, 7, mean, fill = NA, align = "right")
    ) %>%
  select(location_name, date, inf_mean, inf_mean_7d, cases_mean, cases_mean_7d) %>%
 #drop weeks with 0 predicted cases, mostly from March and April 2020 in some islands
  filter(inf_mean_7d != 0 & !is.na(inf_mean_7d) ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
# Calculate column C = A/B only if A and B are both non-missing and not zero
  mutate(
    under_report = 
      ifelse(!is.na(inf_mean_7d) & inf_mean_7d != 0 & !is.na(cases_mean_7d)  
        # & cases_mean_7d != 0, #keeping weeks with )observed but >0 predicted
        , cases_mean_7d/inf_mean_7d, NA)
    ) 
  #%>%
  # select(under_report) %>%   filter(under_report <1) %>% unlist() %>% sort() %>%
  #hist(., freq=TRUE, breaks = 1000)
```







```{r IHME_clean, echo=TRUE}
# need to make sure Georgia, USA is not mixed up with Republic of Georgia
data_under %>% 
  #filter(grepl('Macao', location_name)) %>% 
  select(location_name) %>% 
  #View() %>%
  #remove everything in parentheses
  mutate(location_clean = gsub("\\ \\(.*\\)", "", location_name)) %>%
  mutate(location_clean = gsub("^Macao.*", "Macao", location_name)) %>%
  select(location_clean) %>% table() %>% View()


```
## Group IHME data by location and calculate summary statistics
```{r summary_table}
# 1) for each location summarize Max date, min date, mean, median, max, min, upper and lower quartile
summary_table <- data_under %>% 
  filter(!is.na(inf_mean))
  group_by(location_name) %>%
  summarize(
    n = sum(!is.na(inf_mean)),
    min_date = min(as.Date(date), na.rm = TRUE),
    max_date = max(as.Date(date), na.rm = TRUE),
    mean = mean(under_report, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(under_report, na.rm = TRUE),
    min = min(under_report, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = median(under_report, na.rm = TRUE),
    upper_quartile = quantile(under_report, 0.75,na.rm = TRUE),
    lower_quartile = quantile(under_report, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# View the resulting summary table
View(summary_table)
```


## Including Plots



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
